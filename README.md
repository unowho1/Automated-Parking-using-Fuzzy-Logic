This project demonstrates automatic car parking using fuzzy logic system in MATLAB software. The tstop and tpark fuzzy logic files contains fuzzy logic conditions for stopping and parking the car respectively. The simpark file contains the entire logic of the system which includes direction, reversing and stopping the parking process of the vehicle. The parkfil file is the MATLAB code file for running the logic and displaying the path of the car.
